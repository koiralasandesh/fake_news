A proof-of-concept fake news detection system using syntactic analysis. 

It uses a training file at https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv to train a machine learning model. 

The best performing model (here: SVC) is then used to predict if a provided text was written by humans or machine generated.

A brief introductory video is [here](https://youtu.be/1gNV7csEkKo).
